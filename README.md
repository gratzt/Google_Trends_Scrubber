# Google_Trends_Scrubber
 This project scrubs Google Trends data for a given list of search terms. Users can choose the geographic region and time period for which to download search trends.

The scubber uses Google Chrome and a Chrome Driver (present in the repository), which must sit in the same folder as the Python script.

The provided batch file can be set up with Windows Task scheduler to monitor periodic internet traffic. Users have the option of setting up a Postgresql database, and an example of how to do so is included. Feel free to reach out to me at trevormgratz@gmail with questions.
